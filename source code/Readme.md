The purpose of Phishing Domain Detection is detecting phishing domain names. Therefore, passive queries related to the domain name, which we want to
classify as phishing or not, provide useful information to us. Phishing simulation is the best way to raise awareness of phishing risks and identify which
employees are at risk for phishing. Phishing simulation allows you to incorporate cyber security awareness into your organization in an interactive and 
informative format. Real-time phishing simulationsare a fast and effective way to educate people and increase alertness levels to phishing attacks.
People see first-hand how CEO fraud, emails, fake websites, malware and spear phishing are used to steal personal and corporate information
